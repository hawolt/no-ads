currently the extension is only available for chromium based browsers (NOT FIREFOX)
goto release tab download: "local-server.exe" and launch it, download extension-chromium, in chrome goto extensions -> manage extensions, top right enable developer mode and drag the zip into the window, now navigate to twitch and open a livestream, right to the subscribe button you should have a new button which will replace the stream player to a variant that has no ads

currently probably very buggy and glitchy to use, first released just made it somewhat work, open for PR's if you are bored :thumbsup:
